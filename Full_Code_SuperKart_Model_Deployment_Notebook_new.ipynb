Businesses use the sales forecast to estimate weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual sales totals. A company needs to make an accurate sales forecast as it adds value across an organization and helps the different verticals to chalk out their future course of action.\n","\n","Forecasting helps an organization plan its sales operations by region and provides valuable insights to the supply chain team regarding the procurement of goods and materials. An accurate sales forecast process has many benefits which include improved decision-making about the future and reduction of sales pipeline and forecast risks. Moreover, it helps to reduce the time spent in planning territory coverage and establish benchmarks that can be used to assess trends in the future."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"Aasy7LC_Qpq5","metadata":{"id":"Aasy7LC_Qpq5"},"source":["## Objective"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"khshBslaQtX9","metadata":{"id":"khshBslaQtX9"},"source":["SuperKart is a retail chain operating supermarkets and food marts across various tier cities, offering a wide range of products.
